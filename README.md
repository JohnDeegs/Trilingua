This is a prototype website created for my fourth year Usability Design module.

This module entailed creating a prototype website and using various testing techniques such as the Think Out Loud test and the 5 Second Test. This folder also contains a 10 minutes video of my think out loud test that I conducted with a volunteer user.

For this website I used mostly HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. I hosted this website on Heroku at https://mysterious-eyrie-58336.herokuapp.com/.

This project recieved a grade of 70%, thus it was graded at an honours level.
